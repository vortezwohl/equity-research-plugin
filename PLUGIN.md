    }
  ],

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Found After Installation

**Problem**: `/trading-ideas:research` command not recognized after installation.

**Solutions:**
1. Restart Claude Code (recommended)
2. Verify installation: `/plugin marketplace list`
3. Check plugin is enabled: `/plugin`
4. Reinstall: `/plugin uninstall trading-ideas@equity-research-marketplace` then `/plugin install trading-ideas@equity-research-marketplace`

### Limited Data for Small-Cap Stocks

**Problem**: Analysis is sparse for smaller stocks.

**Reason**: Small-cap stocks have limited analyst coverage and fewer public data sources.

**Suggestion**: Use the plugin for preliminary research, supplement with company filings and industry reports.

### Outdated Price Targets

**Problem**: Analyst price targets seem stale.

**Reason**: Some stocks have infrequent analyst updates.

**Note**: The plugin fetches the most recent available data. Check the dates in the output to assess freshness.

### "Too Many Requests" Error

**Problem**: Error message when running multiple analyses rapidly.

**Reason**: Rate limiting from data sources.

**Solution**: Wait 30-60 seconds between queries. The plugin fetches data from multiple sources simultaneously.

### Wrong Ticker Symbol

**Problem**: No data returned or wrong company analyzed.

**Solution**: Verify ticker symbol on Yahoo Finance or company website. Use US ticker for ADRs.
